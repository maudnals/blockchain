#### Web3:

- web2: the web of interactivity and social media
- web3: the decentralized, pro-privacy, pro-transparency, anti-monopoly web. Rather than concentrating the power (and data) in the hands of huge companies with questionable motives, it would be returned the rightful owners.

Advantages:

- No central point of control: Middlemen are removed from the equation. Blockchains provide a trustless platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is fully encrypted. Alphabet and Apple will no longer have control of user data. No government or entity will have the ability to kill sites and services; and no single individual can control the identities of others.
- Ownership of data: End users will regain complete control of data and have the security of encryption. Information can then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis. No more big companies like Amazon and Facebook will store dietary preferences, income, credit card details to sell them to marketers and advertisers.
- Reduction in hacks and data breaches: Because data will be decentralized and distributed, hackers would need to turn off the entire network, while state-sponsored tools such as Vault7, used by the three-letter agencies, would be rendered obsolete. At present, internet companies are compelled to hand over user data or succumb to having the entire database scrutinized. These data intrusions arenâ€™t just limited to major security threats such as terrorism; in 2017, Coinbase took the IRS to court over its demand to see the data of over 15,000 customers.
