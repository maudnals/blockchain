A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new type of identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with
high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. DIDs are typically associated with cryptographic
material, such as public keys, and service endpoints, for establishing secure communication
channels. 



DIDs are useful for any application that benefits from self-administered,
cryptographically verifiable identifiers such as personal identifiers, organizational identifiers, and
identifiers for Internet of Things scenarios. For example, current commercial deployments of W3C
Verifiable Credentials heavily utilize Decentralized Identifiers to identify people, organizations, and
things and to achieve a number of security and privacy-protecting guarantees. This document is an
introduction to the concept of Decentralized Identifiers.
