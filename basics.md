### Nonce:
Arbitrary number than can be used only once.

### Proof Of Work:
Blockchain is a decentralized database, so it needs to be secured by incentivizing participants in the network.

This means:
- reward participants that facilitate the goals of the network
- make attackers waste money. 

And securing the network this way is the job of the consensus algorithm. 
2 types of consensus algorithms:
- proof of stake PoS
- proof of work PoW  

A miner:  
- verifies transactions 
- organizes these transactions into a block
- distributes completed blocks (already solved) throughout the network, this happens very quickly and is not energy intensive. What is energy intensive is the “lottery system” or “puzzle” that miners need to solve in order to create a valid block.

### Consensus algorithm: 
A process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed systems.

Questions:
- mining (= add a transaction onto the blockchain) vs token creation
- block content

Note: there's a tradeoff speed-security: how do defend the network from attackers while maintaining a certain level of transaction speed for their users?
